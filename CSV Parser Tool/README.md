# CSV Parser Tool

This project is a **bash script** designed to manage and interact with a CSV-based contact list. It allows users to perform several operations on a CSV file that contains contact information such as names, phone numbers, and addresses. The script offers the following features:

- **View Contacts:** Display all entries in the CSV file.
- **Search by Surname:** Search for and display contacts by their surname.
- **Edit City Names:** Modify all occurrences of a specified city name within the contact list.
- **Delete Rows:** Remove an entire contact entry based on the specified row number.


### How to Use
1. Ensure that the script and your contact list (CSV file) are in the same directory.
2. Run the script, passing your CSV file as an argument:
   ```bash
   ./ScriptEsame2.sh contacts.csv
